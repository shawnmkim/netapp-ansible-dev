# Here is the loop way of doing nested loops
"{{ netapp.ontap_info.cluster_node_info|product(broadcast_domains)|list }}" | product(<second list>) | list

# subelements: When the second list is a list within the first list.
# for each vservers' entry, it will loop through the lifs' list ('subelements('lifs')')
# which is part of the vserver entry and its sub-elements.
"{{ vservers|subelements('lifs') }}"
